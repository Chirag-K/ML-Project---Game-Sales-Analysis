# The purpose of this Kernel is to investigate whether or not an accurate Machine Learning model can be built to forecast 
video game sales in units based on the features given in this dataset. This hypothesis is investigated with numerous 
supervised ML models.

Ultimately, a decision to forecast only aggregated global sales was made due to the inherently global nature of the 
video game industry. Several features were droppped in the process as well due to a huge potential influx of dummy 
variables post-feature engneering.
